    <h2>Question 11</h2>
    <p>To obtain a magnification of +2 with a concave mirror of radius of curvature 60 cm the object distance must be?</p>
</article>
<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>Given, magnification,m = +2<br>Radius of curvature,R = -60 cm,<br>As, magnification = -v/u<br>v=-2u<br>and f = -R/2 = -60/2 = -30 cm<br>From mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u<br>1/-30 = 1/-2u + 1/u<br>1/-30 = 1/2u<br> u = -15 cm</p>

    <h2>Question 12</h2>
    <p>The image formed by a spherical mirror is real, inverted and its magnification is -2. If the image is at a distance of 30 cm from the mirror, where is the object placed? Find the focal length of the mirror. List two characteristics of the image formed if the object is moved 10 cm towards the mirror.</p>
</article>
<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>Since the image formed is real and inverted, the mirror is concave.<br>
        Magnification = −vu ⇒ -2 = −vu ⇒ v = 2u<br>
        Now, if v = – 30 cm then u = – 15 cm<br>
        As focal length of the mirror is<br>
        f = uv/u+v<br>−15×−30/−15−30<br>f=450/−45 = -10 cm<br>
        If the object is shifted 10 cm towards the mirror, then the object is between principal focus and the optical centre and the image formed will be virtual and erect.</p>

    <h2>Question 13</h2>
    <p>Sudha finds that a sharp image of the windowpane of her science laboratory is formed from the lens at a distance of 15 cm. Then she tries to focus on the building, which is visible to her outside the window, instead of the windowpane without disturbing the lens. To obtain a sharp image of the building, in which direction will she move the screen? What is the optimal focal length of this lens?</p>
</article>
<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>Sudha will move the screen toward the lens so that the final image is in focus. The focal length is less than 15 cm, as the building can be treated as an object at an infinite distance.</p>

    <h2>Question 15</h2>
    <p>Calculate the magnification of the image of an object placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a concave mirror of focal length 15 cm. The object is at a distance of 20 cm from the mirror. </p>
</article>
<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>Given, focal length of concave mirror,
        f = -15 cm<br>
        Object distance, u = -20 cm<br>
        Image distance, v = ?<br>
        Using mirror formula,<br>
        <img src="question 15.png"><br>
        Using magnification formula,<br>
        m = –v/u = -(−60/−20) or m = -3<br>
